## Overview

This is a project template folder for BSc thesis projects, and MSc
semester and thesis projects conducted at the Global Health Engineering
group at ETH Zurich. The folder contains a structure for generated data
with guidance on how to store raw and derived data. Templates are
provided for metadata and documentation. A style guide provides an
outline and general guidance on report writing. The guide is provided as
a MS Word .docx file, but can also be edited with Google Docs, as Google
Drive is used for file management. The outline of the style guide is
also provided as a Quarto file (.qmd), which can be used for report
writing. Depending on the set of tools for data analysis and report
writing, some files are only relevant in specific cases.

## Version control

This folder is under version control using the git version control
system. Students that do not work with git version control also do not
need to start, but it allows those that can to do it. Despite the folder
being stored within a Google Workspace, it contains an RStudio project
file (.Rproj) which can be used to open the folder (project) with the
RStudio IDE. This allows students who are not familiar with the using a
terminal.

## Computational Competencies

Within the GHE group, we have competent practitioners in using STATA and
R. Students are free to use any other programming language for data
analysis (Python, SQL, Julia, etc.), but no support can be provided for
code review. Students using R for their data analysis are free to use .R
scripts or literate programming tools, such as R Markdown and Quarto.
